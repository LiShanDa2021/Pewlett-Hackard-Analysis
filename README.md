# Pewlett Hackard Retirement Analysis
Analysis of company employee retirement eligibility

## Purpose
Pewlett Hackard is facing a "silver tsunami". As an established company, thousands of its employees are approaching retirement. That means there be thousands of vacancies, but that is not all. The departing workers not only leave empty positions, they also take years of experience and wisdom with them. We will need to do more than just hire new people. We will need to train them. Because of my familiarity with SQL, I was tasked with helping the company prepare by identifying how many vacancies it would have to fill in which roles as well as how many current employees could act as mentors to new hires. With the help of data, we can get ahead of the silver tsunami and surf it to the golden shore of the future.

## Results
Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

The chart below shows the number of vacancies by title the silver tsunami will create. Below the chart are conclusions that can be drawn from it.
